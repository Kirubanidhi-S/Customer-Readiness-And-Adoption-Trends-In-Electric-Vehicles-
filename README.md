# Customer-Readiness-And-Adoption-Trends-In-Electric-Vehicles-
To evaluate customer readiness for EV adoption
## 🚗 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

* This project analyzes **customer readiness and adoption trends in Electric Vehicles (EVs)** using structured survey data.
* It converts raw responses into measurable metrics like **Intent Score, Readiness Score, and Concern Index**.
* The objective is to identify **awareness levels, motivation drivers, and key adoption barriers**.
* Insights are generated using tools such as **Microsoft Excel**, **MySQL**, **Power BI**, and **Google Forms**.
* The final output supports data-driven decision-making for EV manufacturers and policymakers.

## 📁 **DATA SET OVERVIEW**

* Survey-based structured dataset collected through online forms
* Contains demographic variables (age group, occupation, city type)
* Includes usage variables (travel distance, fuel expense, vehicle ownership)
* Awareness indicators (knowledge of EVs, review exposure)
* Adoption intent responses (Yes / Maybe / No)
* Concern factors (charging, price, range, maintenance)
* Motivation drivers (fuel savings, environmental concern, subsidy influence)

---

## 📈 **ANALYTICAL METHODS**

* Data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel
* Score conversion (categorical to numerical values)
* Creation of derived metrics:

  * **Intent Score**
  * **Readiness Score**
  * **Concern Index**
* SQL aggregation queries (segment-wise comparison)
* Correlation analysis between awareness and readiness
* Dashboard visualization and KPI tracking

---

## 🎯 **SCOPE OF THE STUDY**

* Measures customer awareness and adoption readiness
* Evaluates motivation and concern factors
* Segment-wise analysis (age, city type, usage level)
* Trend analysis of EV interest
* Dashboard-based visualization for decision support
* Limited to survey-based perception data (not actual purchase behavior)

---

## 🗄️ **DATA SET AND ANALYSIS**

* Data collected via structured questionnaire
* Exported and cleaned in Excel
* Uploaded into MySQL for structured querying
* SQL queries performed for:

  * Average readiness by segment
  * Concern comparison across city types
  * Adoption intent distribution
  * Fuel expense vs EV interest analysis
* Results visualized in Power BI using:

  * KPI cards
  * Bar charts
  * Segment comparison charts
  * Trend visuals

---

## 💡 **INSIGHTS DELIVERED**

* EV adoption intent varies significantly across city types
* Higher awareness strongly increases readiness score
* Fuel cost pressure positively influences EV interest
* Charging infrastructure remains the dominant concern
* Younger and high-travel users show stronger adoption probability
* Motivation factors directly impact readiness levels

---

## 🏁 **FINAL OUTPUT**

* Cleaned and structured analytical dataset
* SQL-based segmented analysis results
* Interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs
* Adoption readiness scoring model
* Strategic recommendations for improving EV adoption
* Business insights report for stakeholders
